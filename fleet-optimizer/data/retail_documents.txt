RETAIL ANALYTICS KNOWLEDGE BASE

SALES FORECASTING BEST PRACTICES:
1. Seasonal Patterns: Most retail businesses experience seasonal fluctuations. Electronics sales peak during holiday seasons (November-December) and back-to-school periods (August-September). Clothing sales follow fashion seasons with spring/summer and fall/winter collections.

2. Trend Analysis: Use moving averages to identify underlying trends. Short-term trends (7-14 days) help with immediate inventory decisions, while long-term trends (30-90 days) inform strategic planning.

3. Anomaly Detection: Sales anomalies can be caused by:
   - Promotional events and marketing campaigns
   - External factors (weather, holidays, economic events)
   - Supply chain disruptions
   - Competitive actions
   - Product lifecycle changes

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES:
1. Safety Stock Calculation: Safety stock = (Maximum daily usage × Maximum lead time) - (Average daily usage × Average lead time)

2. Reorder Point Formula: Reorder Point = (Average daily usage × Lead time) + Safety stock

3. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): EOQ = √((2 × Annual demand × Order cost) / Holding cost per unit)

4. ABC Analysis: 
   - A items: 20% of products, 80% of sales (high priority)
   - B items: 30% of products, 15% of sales (medium priority)
   - C items: 50% of products, 5% of sales (low priority)

RETAIL METRICS AND KPIs:

   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
   - Customer Retention Rate
   - Net Promoter Score (NPS)

SEASONAL PATTERNS BY CATEGORY:
1. Electronics:
   - Peak: Holiday season (Nov-Dec), Back-to-school (Aug-Sep)
   - Low: January-February (post-holiday)
   - Factors: New product releases, technology trends

2. Clothing:
   - Peak: Fashion seasons (Spring/Summer, Fall/Winter)
   - Low: End of season clearance periods

   - Low: Winter months (December-February)
   - Factors: Home improvement projects, gardening seasons

ANOMALY DETECTION METHODS:
1. Statistical Methods:
   - Z-score analysis (detects values > 2 standard deviations from mean)
   - Moving average with control limits
   - Seasonal decomposition

2. Machine Learning Approaches:
   - Isolation Forest
   - One-Class SVM
   - Autoencoders
   - LSTM-based anomaly detection

3. Business Rule-Based:
   - Percentage change thresholds
   - Day-of-week comparisons
   - Holiday adjustments

FORECASTING MODELS:
1. Time Series Models:
   - Prophet: Good for seasonal patterns and trend changes
   - ARIMA: Effective for stationary time series
   - Exponential Smoothing: Simple but effective for short-term forecasts

2. Machine Learning Models:
   - Random Forest: Good for capturing non-linear relationships
   - XGBoost: Effective for complex patterns
   - LSTM: Excellent for long-term dependencies

3. Ensemble Methods:
   - Combine multiple models for better accuracy
   - Weighted averaging based on historical performance
   - Model selection based on data characteristics

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS:
1. Store Performance Analysis:
   - Compare stores within same region
   - Identify top and bottom performers
   - Analyze regional differences
   - Assess store-specific factors (location, size, demographics)

2. Product Performance:
   - Identify best and worst selling products
   - Analyze product lifecycle stages
   - Cross-selling opportunities
   - Product cannibalization effects

3. Customer Behavior:
   - Purchase patterns and preferences

   - Price sensitivity analysis
   - Customer segmentation

RECOMMENDATION STRATEGIES:
1. Inventory Optimization:
   - Right-size inventory based on demand forecasts
   - Implement just-in-time (JIT) for fast-moving items
   - Use vendor-managed inventory (VMI) for strategic partnerships
   - Consider consignment inventory for new products

2. Pricing Strategies:
   - Dynamic pricing based on demand and competition
   - Promotional pricing for slow-moving inventory
   - Bundle pricing for complementary products
   - Seasonal pricing adjustments

3. Marketing Optimization:
   - Target promotions based on customer segments
   - Optimize timing of marketing campaigns
   - Personalize offers based on purchase history
   - A/B test different promotional strategies
